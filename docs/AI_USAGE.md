# AI Usage Documentation

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)** was used to:
  - Produce starter Python scripts (`scraper.py`, `validators.py`, `transformers.py`).
  - Write documentation templates (`BUSINESS_CASE.md`, `ETHICS.md`, `README.md`).
  - Suggest repository structure and best practices for scraping.

## Human Involvement
- All code will be **tested, debugged, and maintained** by the project team.
- Manual review is required for:
  - Checking `robots.txt` and ToS.
  - Validating schema correctness after scraping.
  - Ensuring ethical scraping practices are followed.

## AI-Generated vs Human-Modified
- **AI-Generated**: Draft code files, documentation templates, repo layout.
- **Human-Modified**: Testing, bug fixes, integration with fantasy valuation models, and final presentation formatting.

## Known Limitations
- AI cannot **verify robots.txt restrictions** in real-time. This must be done manually.
- Web scraping code may require adjustments if FootballDBâ€™s HTML structure changes.
- Generated transformers are **simplified multipliers**; deeper fantasy models need domain expertise.
