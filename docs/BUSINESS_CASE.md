# Business Case: Defense-Adjusted Fantasy Player Evaluator

## Problem
Fantasy football player valuations often fail to account for **defensive context**. Current models mostly emphasize player-level stats (yards, touchdowns, usage rates) while ignoring whether opposing defenses are strong or weak against specific positions.

## Solution
A **Defense-Adjusted Fantasy Player Evaluator**:
- Pulls **defensive statistics** (points allowed, sacks, interceptions) from FootballDB.
- Incorporates defensive performance into fantasy projections.
- Highlights when QB or RB performance is likely to deviate from baseline due to matchup context.

## Benefits
- **Deeper player insights**: Adds a layer of matchup-based realism for fantasy players.
- **Smarter decisions**: Helps users optimize weekly start/sit choices and draft picks.
- **Scalable foundation**: Can extend to include WR/TE impacts, weekly splits, or advanced defensive analytics.

## Target Users
- Fantasy football players (casual → advanced).
- Analysts or content creators looking for matchup-driven projections.
- Potential integration with fantasy platforms for premium insights.

## Competitive Advantage
- Most fantasy valuation tools don’t deeply integrate **defense-adjusted multipliers**.
- This project bridges that gap with **validated, ethical data collection** and **transparent analytics**.
